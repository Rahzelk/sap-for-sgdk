 *           This is a Sweep and Prune algorithm for collision detection.
 *       
 *           Developped for a Megadrive homebrew game using  SGDK devkit.
 *           This Sweep And Prune works on the X axis.
 *           Note that a quick check on the Y axis is done before calling a custom function
 *           (then you can do narrow phase or direct handling of the collision)
